# Unsupervised machine learning homework 
## Read the data using read csv function, checked and cleaned the data frame to make sure there were no issues with the data.
### Then ploted the data to show the elbow curve of the clusters in order to find what the correct number of clusters would be.

### Then I created a model using Kmeans to implement the amount of clusters I thought would be correct

### Then I plotted the Kmeans Data

## Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis is the next step

### With that optimization I found going through the proccess lead to less steps with similar accuracy and results.
